Major:

- On Android, the input text cursor is sometime invisible. Reproductible procedure:
  1- Open the application.
  2- Select a place and select "start from this place".
  3- The itinerary finder opens with the "from" input filled and the "to" one empty.
  4- Touch the "to" input text --> the virtual keyboard show up but there is no cursor.

- When no internet connection is available (or when the RequireJS scripts take too long time to load (timeout)), show an error message and close the application.

Minor:

- Add params to nativeMap.buildView in order to set the default latitude/longitude/zoom.

- Implement TileOverlay.removeTileOverlay.

- In the itinerary finder, allow the user to tell if the date time is the departure time or the arrival time.

- In the itinerary finder, add '-30min' and '+30min' buttons.

- Add a forum where users can communicate about Open Travel Mate.
