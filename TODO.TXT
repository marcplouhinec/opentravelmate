Critical:

- On the web version (Safari on Ipad), the web application takes more than 100% of the window. Moreover, the itinerary details in the footer panel is not scrollable.


Major:

- Make the "More" menu

- Properly align footer panel title and minimized side panel title on Android

- In find itineraries, scroll the date time suggestions correctly on Android

- Clear the found places when the place finder is closed

- On the itinerary details (footer panel), show the origin and destination places that have been entered in the side panel

- When an itinerary is shown, zoom out if the itinerary is not completely visible.

- On Android, the input text cursor is sometime invisible. Reproductible procedure:
  1- Open the application.
  2- Select a place and select "start from this place".
  3- The itinerary finder opens with the "from" input filled and the "to" one empty.
  4- Touch the "to" input text --> the virtual keyboard show up but there is no cursor.


Minor:

- Add params to nativeMap.buildView in order to set the default latitude/longitude/zoom.

- Implement TileOverlay.removeTileOverlay.

- Update the documentation (no menu widget anymore, new function nativeMap.removeMapButton())

- In the itinerary finder, allow the user to tell if the date time is the departure time or the arrival time.

- In the itinerary finder, add '-30min' and '+30min' buttons.

- When the Android application is started, the nativemap waits several seconds before starting downloading tiles. The downloading map button should be displayed as soon as the application starts.

- Improve the way the downloading map button is displayed: if several onTilesDisplayed events are sent, the first response will hide the button even if more responses are expected. Hide the button when all the responses have been received.
